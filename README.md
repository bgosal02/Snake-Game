# Snake-Game
Designed an intricate snake game using Python’s multiprocessing module via multithreading programming to demonstrate my ability to improve code by increased throughput, better responsiveness, resource efficiency, and parallelism.
Leveraged Python’s Tkinter module to create a graphic user interface and smooth user experience to control the snake’s movement using arrow keys and to allow quick responsiveness via click buttons for interaction.
Created a unique chat application leveraging Python 3 standard library modules of socket, multiprocessing, threading, and Tkinter to provide chat clients the ability to communicate internally via a server using TCP socket programming.
